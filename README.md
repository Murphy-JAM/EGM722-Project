# EGM722-Project
# Belfast Greenspace - Deprivation and Provision 

# For reference this project was developed on a Windows PC. First it is important to download all of the data included below to a named local folder:
# - Small Area Boundaries (NISRA > Geography > Digital Products > NI Small Areas Shapefile.  
# - Multiple Deprivation Measure 2017 (NISRA > NINIS > Deprivation > NI Multiple Deprivation Measure 2017 (statistical geographies) CSV file. 
# - Belfast City Parks (OpenDataNI > Tourism, Culture, Leisure and Arts > Belfast City Parks CVS file. 

# In order to access and run the project script, a number of applications will need to be downloaded and installed beforehand (these are listed below):
# -Git 2.40.1.
# -GitHub Desktop 3.2.2. 
# -Anaconda Navigator 2.4.0. 
# -An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - this project script was written using PyCharm Community Edition 2023.1.1. 

# Once this is all complete you can setup a GitHub account online and sign in through the GitHub Desktop application so that the project information can be downloaded (e.g. 'pulled') from the repository.  

# To ‘pull’ the project information to your named local folder the repository files will need to be forked first to your account and then cloned. Next you will need to set up the project environment. Open the Anaconda Navigator application and import the ‘Environment.yml’ file previously cloned to your named local folder. Once this has been set up the main dependencies (shown below) should be listed: 
# -Python >3.5 
# -Geopandas 
# -Folium 

# In order to view and edit the project script, an Integrated Development Environment will need to be configured. For PyCharm this means adding the python interpreter from the Anaconda project environment to the application. Finally, bring in the cloned project script from your named local folder and keep track of any changes made to the remote repository via the ‘commit’ and upload e.g. ‘push’ functions.
